Spiral Matrix II (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/
Initial thought: Simple simulation problem. Just switch when find edge.

Solution: Optimal. But better one in Solution. Add your offset edge dir to a list, and when changing dir get offset array based on index of dir. I got an idea there but didn't fully span out, so damn.

What to learn: Cool simulation problem.
