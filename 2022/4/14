Zigzag Conversion (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/
Initial thought: I have a feeling this is a math problem, but I'm bad at math lmao. So I just laid out a matrix and laid input string zigzag-ly. Then just loop through and StringBuilder it.

Solution: Optimal, since it's O(n), but practically it's slow lol. Looked at Solution, and the optimal problem is to visit String like as if i'm matrix visiting it, but do it mathematically.

What to learn: Math-based problem.
