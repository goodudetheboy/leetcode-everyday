Happy Number (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/
Initial thought: Thought this one was gonna be EZPZ, just need to use HashSet, but I overlooked the problem. We can solve this using Floyd's cycle finding algo, and that shows up a whole damn lot in my previous leetcode. Damn.

Solution: Practically optimal, but could be better with Floyd's cycle finding.

What to learn: Floyd's cycle finding.

Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-one-string-swap-can-make-strings-equal/
Initial thought: Pretty easy conceptually, but didn't think through every edge cases lmao. Sleepy af just wanna finish shit

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Think through all cases.

Search in Rotated Sorted Array II (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/
Intial thought: In a bit of a rush now, so just do this linearly lol. Surprisingly this is just as fast as the other one. Simple but cool. Probably not gonna be a real world problem though.

Solution: Some thing to do with checking the first element. I thought of this too but like I said I'm in a bit of a rush. Will do this again tho.

What to learn: This problem.

Find the Duplicate Number (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/
Initial thought: Sorting would work. But O(nlogn). HashSet would work. But O(n) space. No idea how else I'm gonna approach this. Looked at Solution...

Solution: So fucking smart lmao. Use Array as a HashMap, since the number is constrained between 1 and n. Fuck me. I should have read the prompt carefully lmao. There's a binary search sol that uses number of value, but that's not as cool. This thing use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare too!

What to learn: Array as HashMap. AND READ THE PROMPT CAREFULLY.
