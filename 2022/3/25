Broken Calculator (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/broken-calculator/
Initial thought: I thought of just going from startValue to target. Whenever less than half of target, multiply 2, else minus one. It works... for most of it. Problem is for big gaps between startValue and target. It cant get a good grasp of what to build up from. Looked at Solution...

Solution: Go from target to startValue. Way easier. Just div 2, if not %2 then add 1 then continue until target less than target Value, then just done

What to learn: Look both ways when doing greedy problems.

Initial thought: Another ez one KEKLUL. Mod 10 and add.

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Nothing.

Two City Scheduling (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/
Initial thought: Just get the smallest out of two. That would suck tho. So stop thinking then go back. Sort by diff! Then just get half for A and half for B. Done!

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Some cool sorting in Greedy problem.
