Pow(x,n) (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/
Initial thought: Simple recursion. Just get x then multiple by pow(x,n-1). Stack overflow, unlucky. Then thought of splitting in half instead. Still stack overflow. Looked at Discussion, turns out you don't have to do the other half. Got done O(logn) time.

Solution: Optimal solution.

What to learn: Try to optimize recursion next time.
