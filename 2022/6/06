Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/
Initial thought: I know that getting K smallest we need to build minHeap, but this shit gives TLE. I resort to using Solution.

Solution: The optimal solution is O(nlogk). We first add k smallest into the heap by nums1[0] nums2[1], then we poll, add to result, then add the pair [i+1, j], i j from the poll, to the heap, then continue k times. I honestly would not think of this in an interview.

What to learn: Optimized heap building.
