Maximum Erasure Value (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-erasure-value/
Initial thought: Classic two pointers+sliding windows problem. Maintain left pointer, find next duplicate, then just move the left pointer removing the dups and curSum. Simple O(n).

Solution: Semi-otpimal. A tiny bit more optimization is maintaining a prefix sum from previous duplicates, then just deduct it, instead of having to move left pointer.

What to learn: Wacky sliding windows tech

Subarray Sum Equals K (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/
Initial thought: I did a similar problem yesterday, but I didn't quite understand how it works, so I just follow suit to what I remember. But I forgor that this array also have negative integer, so that's that. Looked at Discussion.

Solution: My solution is close, but I just need to do a bit count bookkeeping, since there can be nonnegative. Also prefix sum is very used in hash table I can see.

What to learn: Prefix sum bookkeeping.
