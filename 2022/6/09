Jump Game (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/
Initial thought: This is the problem where I think more complicated than necessary. We don't need to trace the steps, we just need to whether we can reach it. I essentially just bruteforce from the way back. And the result is, you guess it, TLE baby.

Solution: Keep track of max reach, traverse the array, if current index is more than max, you know we can't reach the end. It's that simple. And I couldn't do it. wtf.

What to learn: Keep thigs simple in your mind.
