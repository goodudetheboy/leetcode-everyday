Course Schedule III (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/
Initial thought: I thought of using a PQ to approach this problem, and well, I was in the right direction. I thought of a way to somehow sort the courses by whatever quota first, but then it occurs that none worked, cuz of one edge case and another. So I resorted to using Solution.

Solution: Instead of pre-sorting by the some criteria, just sort it by start time, and during traversal, add whatever you occur, and if the time is more, then just remove the poll and add the new one if it appears to be better. Heck.

What to learn: Pre-sorting was correct, but I need to be a bit more smart in the post-processing of post-sort.

Redundant Connection (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/
Initial thought: At first glance, I thought this was gonna be a simple BFS problem. Union find or whatnot, it's just finding cycles. Then I set out to do so.

Solution: Turns out Union finding is much deeper than I thought. First, the optimal solution does not require creating a graph with edges, only need to traverse through the given edges array and work with that. Damn simple.

What to learn: Union find. I think there's more than what meets the eyes here.
