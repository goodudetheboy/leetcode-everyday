Clone Graph (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/ [REPEATED]
Initial thought: This should be easy, I already did this once. Kinda struggling at first with using Stack and HashSet, then get bored and looked at my prev answer. Kinda lame but who cares lol.

Solution: Optimal solution. Just traverse through the graph and keep track of already seen nodes using HashMap<Integer,Node> and Queue for BFS.

What to learn: Practice more on my BFS and DFS and smoother use of data structure.

Valid Anagram (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
Initial thought: Just counting problem. HashMap for the fat O(n). Traverse through first string to count characters. Then traverse through the second string to decrement characters. Less than 0 or not found will return false.

Solution: Optimal solution!

What to learn: Gotta code FASTER!
