Compare Version Numbers (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/
Initial thought: Medium? More like easy keklol. Just split strings up by "\\.", then traverse through every thing, if passed len then treat as 0. Optimal solution, too ez 4 me.

Solution: Only need to traverse to max of two arrays len, but it still the same shit anyway.

What to learn: Think it through AGAIN before getting to code.
