Single Number (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
Initial thought: Approaching this problem was a bit of a problem: it forces me to do O(n) time and O(1) space. Linear time could be using HashMap<Integer, Boolean> and add elements in there, then check for false, but that would mean O(n) space. I think of maybe keeping a sum of half of everything, but turns out that won't work either. I think of maybe scaling it someway can help it, but then again that scaling won't work. Cool. Then I think of doing range. Not work too.

Solution: I check Discussion section. Turns out we can solve this with XOR. Since XOR is associative, and XOR of two numbers is 0, the final XOR of everything is the answer.

What to learn: XOR and binary operators


Palindrom Number (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/
Initial thought: Easy. Just convert it to string then check from start to finish. But that is very inefficient. I think I maybe can flip the number using modulus, but there are the problem of overflow. Unlucky.

Solution: I check Solution section. Flip HALF of the digits instead, then compare to the second half. 

What to learn: Negative numbers are NOT palindrome. We can also weed out numbers with 0 at start. Also think in half next time.
