Swap Nodes in Pairs (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/
Initial thought: When it comes to LinkedList, it has to be recursion. Simple. This can be solved by considering two nodes in a function, and the next of second node could be whatever returned from the next call of swap function. Simple as that.

Solution: Same as mine, but the others are more optimized in space complexity. Mine is O(n) due to recursion, while some using while loop has O(1).

What to learn: Difference between recursion and while-loop, might be important in interviews.
