Word Ladder (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/
Initial thought: Did this. Easy BFS baby.
--------------------------

Solution: Optimal, I think. There is a solution that uses HashSet then changes each char within the word with A-Z and check for it inside rather than checking individually like what I did. Though the runtime is similar.

What to learn: BFS tech.

--------------------------
Word Ladder II (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/
Initial thought: I figured it would be the same as Word Ladder I, but there is a bit more to it. The queue needs to adapt to the list of trace. Then it's smooth sailing. But the runtime is pretty trash tho.

Solution: Semi-optimal. Standard BFS exercise. There is a way, way better solution in the discussion that uses bi-directional BFS, so I will do this again later.

What to learn: BFS shit.

Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/
Initial thought: Yeah fuck this DS design. I wrote a shitton of code, but then it couldn't run, so I looked at Discussion, and they were doing it in 4 lines, in total. FUCK

Solution: Just simple DFS nesting.

What to learn: Fuck I'm so shit and these DS design thing.
