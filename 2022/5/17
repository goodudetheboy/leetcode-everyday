Find Peak Element (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/
Initial thought: Simple traversal from start to end until you find a first decreasing. But this slow. So I switched to binary search. If left < right just move mid to left. Done.

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Peak finding. Very interesting stuff, from what I read in the comments.
