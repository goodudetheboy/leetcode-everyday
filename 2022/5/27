Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/
Initial thought: I thought I was smart when I use cycle finding in this, but boy am I dumb as shit. This is an inherent math problem, and I fail it big time.

Solution: Just have two heads running from headA and headB, then when at end just switch head. Mathematically this will get you to the necessary loop.

What to learn: I really need to get into math shit.

Palindrome Linked List (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
Initial thought: I just thought of doing the recursive solution. But fuck there is this reverse technique that I don't know of. Fuck

Solution: Fast and slow, and reverse the fast pointer. Don't know what that means, will do this again later.

What to learn: LL sure has a different range of thoughts.

Linked List Random Node (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/
Initial thought: Oh a random-based problem. This is definitely not going to go wrong at all, amirite boys? Really, for a random, it's just simple as randomly choosing some shit out of it. But the Solution has something pretty cool.

Solution: Reservoir sampling. Or something about filling up a reservoir for randoms sampling. Beyond my scope for sure, but I'll keep this in TOLEARN.

What to learn: Reservoir sampling, and probabilistic shit, since this is used a lot in CP.
