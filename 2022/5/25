Pacific Atlantic Water Flow (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/
Initial thought: This takes me more than it should. I actually thought of a good solution, but that didn't pan out too well, and I have been spending quite a long time on this,so I might as well go for the brute force and come back to this with a fresh mind later.

Solution: Didn't look, will do again later.

What to learn: Nothing as of yet.

Minimum Genetic Mutation (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/
Initial thought: This is similar to Word Ladder, but a bit more constrained. Well, who gives a shit. I actually tried using the swapping char technique from those in the discussion, and it worked out pretty well. I went into a Discussion to paste in the code that uses checking individual strings instead of swapping char, and the runtime is pretty much similar.

Solution: Optimal. Also 100th medium!

What to learn: You can try using different techniques on the same problems and see how the runtime fares.
