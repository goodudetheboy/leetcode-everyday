Deepest Leaves Sum (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/
Initial thought: This was pretty easy. I used DFS approach. Just remove the sum when you check deepest depth.

Solution: Optimal, I think. There is a much more cooler iterative approach using BFS, and I should really look into BFS traversal.

What to learn: BFS
