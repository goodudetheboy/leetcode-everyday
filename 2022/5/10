Single Number III (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/
Initial thought: Bit manipulation problem. Problem is, idk how to do bit manipulation, so I just went for Set approach. O(n) time and space.

Solution: Use XOR, then some complicated ass shit to split the two number from the XOR. Lame shit, but might be important during coding interview. idk.

What to learn: XOR duplicate detection. O(1) space.
