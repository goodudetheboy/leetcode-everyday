Battleships in a Board (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/
Initial thought: Simple DFS/BFS problem. But the follow-up is quite interesting. One-pass, no mod, and O(1) space. Very interesting.

Solution: Optimal, technically. Then there's the follow-up.

What to learn: There might be other problems that DFS/BFS is too overkill. Keep an eye out for those.

Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/
Initial thought: I first try the level order traversal approach (BFS), but it runs a tad too slow for my comfort, so I switched to DFS, and voila, it works pretty well.

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Know when BFS/DFS is better.
