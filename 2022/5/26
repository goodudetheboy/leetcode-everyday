--------------------------
Reverse Nodes in k-Group (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
Initial thought: I used a stack to keep track of the sequencfe of nodes, not knowing that you can do that O(1)-ly. FUCK.

Solution: Optimal time, I think. Just a bit iffy in the reverse part, but overall LL ez.

What to learn: Linked List stuff. CodePath is starting and the first thing they're teaching me is LL.

Partition List (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
Initial thought: I solved this using Array. But then I looked at Solution, and oh boy, am I dumb.

Solution: LinkedList is just another form of Array. instead of having an arraylist, you can keep track of before and after using two LL. DUMB ASS BITCH.

What to learn: If you're doing LL problem, think in terms of LL problem. Use LL as an Array alternative.

Reverse Linked List II (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/
Initial thought: Just a bit more advanced version of reverse LL. Here I used the dummy head technique, then just move the pointer up just like normal.

Solution: Optimal. Solution seems a bit more complicated, but I think I have the Optimal solution.

What to learn: Dummy head is damn cool.
