--------------------------
Reverse Nodes in k-Group (Hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
Initial thought: I used a stack to keep track of the sequencfe of nodes, not knowing that you can do that O(1)-ly. FUCK.

Solution: Optimal time, I think. Just a bit iffy in the reverse part, but overall LL ez.

What to learn: Linked List stuff. CodePath is starting and the first thing they're teaching me is LL.
