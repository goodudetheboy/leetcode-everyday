Number of Provinces (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/
Initial thought: Since I'm practicing BFS, I chose to do this instead. Just have a queue every single time you have that. O(n) time and O(n) space.

Solution: Optimal, theoretically. DFS has a bit faster runtime, but who cares amirite boys.

What to learn: Code in both DFS and BFS.

All Paths From Source to Target (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/
Initial thought: DFS might be easier. Did BFS instead.

Solution: Optimal. There's BFS, and that's achieved by pushing into queue the path instead of just number very smort.

What to learn: BFS tech.

Find Bottom Left Tree Value (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/find-bottom-left-tree-value/
Initial thought: BFS should be easier for this one.

Solution: Optimal, in theory. We can do level order traversal by just taking everything out all at once instead of pushing in nulls, which is new shit I learnt.

What to learn: BFS tech.
