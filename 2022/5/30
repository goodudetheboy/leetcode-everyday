Linked List in Binary Tree (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/
Initial thought: I thought there is some fucking smart ass approach to this, but reading the hints and the Discussion it seems like it just brute forcing. And I did it.

Solution: Optimal. Apparently no better way than brute force.

What to learn: Try to do the brute force approach, then build up from there. It's the better progression than just thinking optimally right away.

LRU Cache (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/
Initial thought: Originally idk how to do this, so I looked this up on Google to get an idea. Then BAM. LinkedHashMap. Some shit idk even exists. Then the logic just clicks.

Solution: Optimal. I should really remember this, since this might come up a lot in MANGA interviews, maybe a lot.

What to learn: LinkedHashMap and LRU cache design. REMEMBER THIS!
