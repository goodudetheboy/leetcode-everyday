Linked List in Binary Tree (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/
Initial thought: I thought there is some fucking smart ass approach to this, but reading the hints and the Discussion it seems like it just brute forcing. And I did it.

Solution: Optimal. Apparently no better way than brute force.

What to learn: Try to do the brute force approach, then build up from there. It's the better progression than just thinking optimally right away.
