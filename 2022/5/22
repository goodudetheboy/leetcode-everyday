Binary Tree Postorder Traversal (Easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/

--------------------------
Course Schedule (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
Initial thought: I struggled with thinking this a bit. But then it hits me: I just need to do some cycle detection easy. Onward to Wikipedia to get the pseudocode!

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Cycle detection. Very interesting techs in there.

--------------------------
Course Schedule II (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/
Initial thought: It's just an easy follow-up from previous one. Easy.

Solution: Optimal.

What to learn: Nothing.

--------------------------
Design Add and Search Words Data Structure (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/
Initial thought: Easy data structure baby. Just build a graph. That's all lmao. Then DFS your way to find the word.

Solution: Optimal. Apparently this is a trie (k-ary tree). I didn't even know about this lmao.

What to learn: Trie.

--------------------------
Count Complete Tree Nodes (Medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/
Initial thought: I'm in a bit of a rush now, so I just fucking dfs the bitch out of this. I think I have something, but I'm just lazy lmao. Put this in TODO.

Solution: Semi-optimal for sure, since this is a complete binary tree.

What to learn: later.
